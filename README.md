# Sveltekit With Bootstrap Starter by ssaaqi

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sveltekit`](https://svelte.dev/).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# Clone this repository to start
git clone https://github.com/saaqi/sveltekit-bootstrap-saaqi.git
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `bun install` (or `npm install`), start a development server:

```bash
bun install (or `npm install`)
bun dev (or `npm run dev`)
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
bun run build (or `npm run build`)
```

You can preview the production build with `bun run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
